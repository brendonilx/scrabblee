My scrabble website starts with the user pressing the button of which generates random letters 
data which then displays the letter but also all of the letters values which represent the total 'max' score.
The images are then added to the 'rack'. The images are draggable and can be placed on the board, 
the images will revert back to the original position if not placed on the boards specific area,
if the image is placed on the board, the image would stay and become un-draggable,
The score board is then updated each time when the letter is placed,
the score is accurate and based on each individual letter's data value.

When the button is pressed again the data saved are the players score, which accumlates every game, 
the board then removes and generates a new set of random letters and the game can be played again.

Things that do not work, most importantly I was unable to implement the actual word checker, I could not comphrehend how to check if words
are real words or not, I guess I could have created a small list of words then generate letters from the list but its too late now. My double implementation
also does not function (the multiplyers) but the scores still add up correctly without multiplyers based on the data. Another is that the board where the 
letters are placed is a single div, so the board itself has no logic implemented when it comes to letters and words.
so in short the game generates random letters with values, its then placed on the board where the values add to the score, certain data from the 
game is saved like total score and games played. I just could not implement a method to check words this late it took many days to get this far.
